MCTS: 
    - Look for speedups (Maybe some of the methods can be improved using numba)
    - Figure out a way to run multiple mcts instances at the same time, 
    storing each state in a queue for evaluation by the network 
General: 
    - Add better comments & better doc strings
    - Figure out if the project could benefit from moving to tensorflow
Model: 
    - Update loss function (make it more numerical stable)
    - Move from sigmoid to softmax in the value head
    - Do research into rollout networks
State:
    - Implement history in states (read somewhere that it could work as an attention mechanism)
    - Update the functions related to state in general.
Training:
    - Implement near deterministic play after x moves (lower temperature in MCTS)
    - Save data in json format (could be used for later models)
    - Adaptive learning rate
